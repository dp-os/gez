# Introduction

## Project Background
Gez is a modern micro-frontend framework based on ECMAScript Modules (ESM), focusing on building high-performance, scalable server-side rendering (SSR) applications. As the third-generation product of the Genesis project, Gez has continuously innovated during its technological evolution:

- **v1.0**: Implemented on-demand loading of remote components based on HTTP requests
- **v2.0**: Achieved application integration based on Webpack Module Federation
- **v3.0**: Redesigned the [module linking](/guide/essentials/module-link) system based on native browser ESM

## Technical Background
In the development of micro-frontend architecture, traditional solutions mainly face the following limitations:

### Challenges of Existing Solutions
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Runtime dependency injection and JavaScript sandbox proxies introduce significant performance overhead
- **Isolation Mechanisms**: Custom sandbox environments struggle to match the native module isolation capabilities of browsers
- **Build Complexity**: Build tool modifications for dependency sharing increase project maintenance costs
- **Deviation from Standards**: Special deployment strategies and runtime processing mechanisms deviate from modern web development standards
- **Ecosystem Limitations**: Framework coupling and custom APIs restrict technology stack choices

### Technological Innovations
Gez provides a new solution based on modern web standards:

- **Native Module System**: Utilizes native browser ESM and Import Maps for dependency management, offering faster parsing and execution speeds
- **Standard Isolation Mechanism**: Reliable application isolation based on ECMAScript module scope
- **Open Technology Stack**: Supports seamless integration with any modern frontend framework
- **Optimized Development Experience**: Provides intuitive development patterns and comprehensive debugging capabilities
- **Extreme Performance Optimization**: Achieves zero runtime overhead through native capabilities, combined with intelligent caching strategies

:::tip
Gez focuses on building high-performance, easily extensible micro-frontend infrastructure, particularly suitable for large-scale server-side rendering application scenarios.

## Technical Specifications

### Environment Dependencies
Please refer to the [Environment Requirements](/guide/start/environment) documentation for detailed browser and Node.js environment requirements.

### Core Technology Stack
- **Dependency Management**: Uses [Import Maps](https://caniuse.com/?search=import%20map) for module mapping, with [es-module-shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims) providing compatibility support
- **Build System**: Handles external dependencies based on Rspack's [module-import](https://rspack.dev/config/externals#externalstypemodule-import)
- **Development Toolchain**: Supports ESM hot updates and native TypeScript execution

## Framework Positioning
Gez differs from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/), focusing on providing micro-frontend infrastructure:

- **Module Linking System**: Implements efficient and reliable module import/export
- **Server-side Rendering**: Provides flexible SSR implementation mechanisms
- **Type System Support**: Integrates complete TypeScript type definitions
- **Framework Neutrality**: Supports integration with mainstream frontend frameworks

## Architecture Design

### Centralized Dependency Management
- **Unified Dependency Source**: Centralized third-party dependency management
- **Automated Distribution**: Global automatic synchronization of dependency updates
- **Version Consistency**: Precise dependency version control

### Modular Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples business logic from infrastructure
- **Plugin Mechanism**: Supports flexible module composition and replacement
- **Standard Interfaces**: Standardized inter-module communication protocols

### Performance Optimization
- **Zero Overhead Principle**: Maximizes the use of native browser capabilities
- **Intelligent Caching**: Precise caching strategy based on content hashing
- **On-demand Loading**: Fine-grained code splitting and dependency management

## Project Maturity
Through nearly 5 years of iterative evolution (v1.0 to v3.0), Gez has been fully validated in enterprise-level environments. It currently supports the stable operation of dozens of business projects and continues to drive the modernization of the technology stack. The framework's stability, reliability, and performance advantages have been thoroughly tested in practice, providing a reliable technical foundation for large-scale application development.
